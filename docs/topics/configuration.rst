Configuration
=============

Options
^^^^^^^

webpack.debug
-------------
**Argument:** bool, inherits, default ``False``

If True the server will re-read the stats file for each request and requests
will block while webpack is running. See :ref:`timeout` to configure how long
the requests will wait for webpack.

webpack.static_view
-------------------
**Argument:** bool, default ``True``

If True, pyramid_webpack will automatically set up the static view(s) for you.
Disable this if you want to call ``add_static_view`` yourself (e.g. if you need
to pass in custom parameters).

webpack.bundle_dir
------------------
**Argument:** str

The directory that contains the compiled webpack bundles. This may be in three forms:

* ``raw_relative_path`` - This path will be relative to your root project package
* ``package:relative_path`` - This is a path relative to a package location
* ``/absolute/path`` - An absolute path on disk

You will almost always need to supply a `bundle_dir`, but if you are using an
external webserver for ``webpack.static_view_name``, then you don't need to
provide it.

webpack.static_view_name
------------------------
**Argument:** str, default ``webpack-DEFAULT``

This will be the ``name`` argument passed to `add_static_view
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/api/config.html#pyramid.config.Configurator.add_static_view>`_. 


webpack.stats_file
------------------
**Argument:** str, default ``webpack-stats.json``

The location of the webpack stats file generated by the webpack-bundle-tracker
plugin. This path may be in the same three formats as ``webpack.bundle_dir``.

.. _timeout:

webpack.timeout
---------------
**Argument:** float, inherits, default ``0``

Requests will block for this many seconds while waiting for webpack to finish
compiling (if ``webpack.debug = True``). A value of ``0`` will wait
indefinitely.

webpack.ignore
--------------
**Argument:** list, inherits, default ``*.hot-update.js, *.map``

When getting a bundle, ignore chunks that match these patterns. Uses glob
matching.

webpack.ignore_re
-----------------
**Argument:** list, inherits

When getting a bundle, ignore chunks that match these patterns. Uses PCRE
matching.

webpack.configs
---------------
**Argument:** list

List of names of other webpack configurations to load. See the section below for
more detail.
